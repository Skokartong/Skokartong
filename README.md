👋 Hi there!

I'm a newly graduated Fullstack Developer with a focus on the .NET ecosystem, passionate about building clean, scalable, and user-friendly solutions.

🇸🇪 Based in Sweden, Stockholm.

🚀 I'm driven by curiosity and a strong desire to learn – currently sharpening my skills in REST API development, unit testing, and modern frontend frameworks like Angular and React.

🛠️ On GitHub, you'll mostly find personal side projects, school projects and experiments as I continue to grow and explore new technologies.

🎥 When I’m not coding, I’m probably watching something nerdy (or silly) on YouTube.

Feel free to check out my projects – and don’t hesitate to reach out!
