- 👋 Hi there! I’m a second year fullstack developer student with focus mainly on the .NET platform.
- 🇸🇪 From Sweden!
- 📝 I’m interested in learning new things and watching silly stuff on youtube!
- 🤓 I’m currently learning building REST-APIs and performing unit tests.
- 🛸On GitHub I will be mostly posting school projects and my own side projects. Enjoy!
